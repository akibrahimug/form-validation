# form-validation

## Project Overview

In this project, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

The form is fully customized with conditional behavior and interactivity

Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
